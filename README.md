# Analysing-climate-data-API

Using the World Bank Climate Data API the monthly temperatures and rainfall of four countries from different continents namely, India, France, USA, Australia were extracted and analysis was done on this data. The primary aim of this project was to investigate whether the rise in temperature leads to increase in rainfall, however after data visualisation it was clear that there is no correlation between the two entities.

An interesting insight found during the project was that India and France had more increase in rainfall and negligible increase in temperature, this implies that there are more business opportunities for rainwater harvesting projects and great potential in the agriculture sector in these countries. 

Whereas in Australia and USA the increase in temperature higher than rainfall this could mean that over the years these countries might have good a good market value for solar energy companies.

One major disadvantage was the volume of data, the climate API gives an average temperature of each month over a period of 20 years. Maybe if data of every month of each year was available then more analysis could be done.

• Using more time periods from the past and even obtaining the present data.

• Studying if increase in rainfall could lead to increase in sea levels, to further add to it if sea levels do rise which areas are more likely to be submerged underwater over a period of time.

• If there is no connection between temperature and rainfall, then trying to understand effects of temperature in other areas like food and agriculture. Does increase in temperature cause any change in the amount and type of crops grown in a particular region.
